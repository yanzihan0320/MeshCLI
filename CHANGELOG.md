## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- CopilotKit AI copilot sidebar — an agent that operates the canvas, not just talks about it
- LangGraph Python agent (`apps/agent/`) with multi-LLM support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini)
- BFF server (`apps/bff/`) — CopilotKit Runtime endpoint + LLM proxy with CORS support
- 12 frontend tools the agent can call: create/branch/merge/delete/update/focus nodes, append messages, highlight findings, render previews/proposals/plans/charts
- Generative UI components inline in copilot chat: branch proposals, merge plans, node previews, charts (pie/bar/line via Recharts)
- Real-time canvas-to-agent state synchronization (debounced 80 ms)
- `npm run dev:copilot` — single command to launch frontend + BFF + agent concurrently
- CI: Python test job (pytest, Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 matrix) in parallel with Node job
- Release: PyPI publishing for agent package via OIDC trusted publishing (`agent-v*` tags)
- Google Gemini LLM provider support in the agent
- Color tags and labels on chat nodes — palette picker with 8 colors and custom text labels (#16)
- Copy-to-clipboard button on chat messages (#15)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** LLM API keys are now configured via `apps/agent/.env` instead of the browser Settings panel — the BFF proxies all LLM requests
- **Breaking:** Real LLM usage requires the BFF (`npm run dev:bff` or `npm run dev:copilot`); browser-only mode is limited to the mock provider
- Architecture expanded from browser-only to client-server with BFF and agent
- CI job renamed from `build` to `node` for clarity

### Fixed

- Label badge fallback styling used Tailwind class names instead of CSS values, rendering no styles when no color was set
- Stale closure in palette click-outside handler caused trim to use outdated label value

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Welcome popup for first-time users explaining mock mode and guiding them to configure an LLM provider in Settings

- Workspace management with localStorage persistence and JSON export/import
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting in chat messages
- Minimize, maximize, and collapse node states
